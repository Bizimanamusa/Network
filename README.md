# Network

Network is the new social media for colleges. I noticed that in my unversity when regsitering for classes, it would have good to get the opinions of other professors before taking a professor, also i had  a hard time trying to sell my stuff or get stuff like textbooks, calculators without ordering from sites like  amazon. This application solves all of that.

# Network
The Network was written with fast use in mind. It provides the following key features

  - It has a marketplace when students in a university can upload an item the want to sell or buy, and other students in that university can see it.
  - It gives students the opportunity to share their opinions considering matters within, the school or anything in general
  - Students can create communities relating to their field of study or anything, and other students can join an be a part of it.
  - This application is more like the combination of ( twitter & amazon ) and instead of trending tweets, you have trending school
  - You can also view marketplaces and communities ( groups ) from other universities.
